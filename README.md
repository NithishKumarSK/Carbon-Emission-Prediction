# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction

This project focuses on the **cleaning, preparation, and analysis of global climate change data** to support future carbon emission prediction models. The dataset contains key indicators like land usage, cereal yield, emissions, and more across multiple countries from 1990 to 2011.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Cleaned invalid entries (`''`, `'..'`) and standardized missing values as `NaN`
- Converted all numerical columns to proper data types
- Removed unneeded rows/columns with excessive missing data
- Visualized CO₂ per capita by year and country
- Ready for machine learning models and dashboards

## 📦 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 📈 Next Steps

- Build predictive models for carbon emissions using regression or time-series models
- Integrate the output into a real-time climate change dashboard
- Automate monthly data updates
