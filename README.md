# Carbon-Emission-Prediction

# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction

This project focuses on the **cleaning, preparation, and analysis of global climate change data** to support future carbon emission prediction models. The dataset contains key indicators like land usage, cereal yield, emissions, and more across multiple countries from 1990 to 2011.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Cleaned invalid entries (`''`, `'..'`) and standardized missing values as `NaN`
- Converted all numerical columns to proper data types
- Removed unneeded rows/columns with excessive missing data
- Ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning use
